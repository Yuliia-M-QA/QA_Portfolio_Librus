# 📘 Librus QA Testing Project

This project demonstrates my manual QA approach for testing the **Librus Parent/Family Portal** ([https://portal.librus.pl/rodzina](https://portal.librus.pl/rodzina)).

The goal was to validate core user functionality (login, navigation, forms) and ensure a consistent UI/UX experience across browsers and devices.
